# Gauntlet loop — in-player blur accuracy

**Owner's bar, verbatim (2026-08-25):** "there isn't a single frame that
the other gender is visible and there isn't a single frame where the
wrong gender is blurred up". Plus: "there shouldn't be any frame that is
being blurred which has no human at all", and "for women, blur them
fully — not leave anything, the legs or the hands or the head".

The owner asked for the goal to be sharpened beyond his own wording, so:

## The invariant

For every frame, for every person in it, exactly one of two things is
true, and nothing else appears on screen:

- they are the **opposite** gender (or a child, or unresolved) ⇒ their
  WHOLE body is covered — head, hands, feet, hair, nothing protruding;
- they are the **same** gender ⇒ they are completely sharp.

And: **pixels not belonging to a person are never covered.**

## Failure classes (scored per frame, all terminal)

| class | definition |
|---|---|
| **EXPOSURE** | any part of an opposite-gender person visible unblurred |
| **PARTIAL** | covered person with a limb, hand, foot or hair outside the patch |
| **FALSE COVER** | a same-gender person carrying a patch |
| **GHOST** | a patch over no person at all — empty frame, furniture, hands, a logo, or a patch coasting after its subject left |
| **DRIFT** | a patch that visibly lags, floats, or jitters away from its subject between frames |

EXPOSURE is the worst, but the owner counts all five. "Blur-first" is the
tiebreaker for a genuinely unknown frame, never an excuse for GHOST.

## Symmetry

Every fix is tested in BOTH directions. With `man`, women and children
are covered and men sharp; with `woman`, the inverse. A fix that helps
one direction and quietly breaks the other is a regression, and this is
easy to do because only one of the two paths is exercised by the
baseline video.

## Cost

Mobile is a first-class constraint, not a footnote. Target hardware is a
Helio G88. A fix that buys accuracy at the price of pass cost is judged
on both numbers, and pass cost is measured, not assumed. Record
`lastVerdictMs` / `lastPassMs` alongside the accuracy score every round.

## Edge cases that must never regress

Seek, pause, resume, resolution change, 2x/3x playback, loop back to
start, SPA navigation to another video, fullscreen enter/exit, ad break,
tab hidden then shown. Each of these has produced a stuck or stale patch
at least once.

## How a round runs

1. Pick the next `(query, gender)` pair from the rotation.
   `python gauntlet.py search "<query>" 5` resolves live video ids —
   never hardcode an id.
2. `python gauntlet.py runs/<round>-<gender> <gender> <videoId> <start>
   <count> <step>` captures player-only frames + overlay geometry +
   track state + pass cost.
3. Score EVERY frame by eye against the five classes, comparing
   `fNNN.png` (as the user sees it) against `fNNN_truth.png` (same
   instant, overlays hidden). The pair is what makes scoring objective —
   from the blurred image alone, a correctly-covered person and a
   wrongly-covered one look identical. Record counts and the exact frame
   files that failed.
4. Spawn a critic agent. **Each round's brief must differ from the
   last** — different lens, different question, fresh evidence, and it
   is told what the previous critic already said so it does not repeat
   it. Web search is allowed and encouraged for prior art.
5. Apply what survives scrutiny. Rebuild, re-run the SAME round, confirm
   the failed frames now pass and the passing set did not regress.
6. Commit + push. Append a ROUNDS entry.

## Rotation

| # | query | gender | why this one |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | (fixed) NWoT1ZVd1Lo | man | baseline: adult male + child female, known-hard |
| 2 | (fixed) NWoT1ZVd1Lo | woman | same footage, inverted expectation |
| 3 | ted talk full speech | man | single speaker, stage lighting, slow cuts |
| 4 | news panel discussion | woman | 3-5 people, seated, small faces |
| 5 | cooking show episode | man | hands and objects — the GHOST trap |
| 6 | conference keynote audience | woman | crowd shots, 10+ people (MoveNet caps at 6) |
| 7 | sports post match interview | man | motion, back-turned subjects |
| 8 | classroom lecture | woman | mixed ages — the child gate |

Owner constraint: nothing indecent. Queries stay ordinary.

## Standing rules

- Verify by FRAME, never by test suite alone. A green suite shipped
  three broken releases this week.
- A probe must never be able to throw inside the pipeline. One did, and
  it silently killed every gender verdict for two releases.
- Licences: MIT/Apache/BSD only. Ultralytics YOLO (code AND weights) and
  abewley/SORT are AGPL/GPL — permanently banned. Never copy HaramBlur.

## ROUNDS

- **R0** (2026-08-25) — harness built. Baseline NWoT1ZVd1Lo/man: Linus
  clears, daughter covered, empty desk shots hold 0 patches. Open: one
  frame carried a half-frame GHOST (x 0.000-0.551, y 0.000-1.000).
- **R1** (2026-08-25) — patch geometry reversed to FULL BODY per the
  owner: all 17 keypoints extend the patch (legs included), keypoint
  margin 0.03 -> 0.05, new outward PATCH_MARGIN 0.08, personFromFace
  widened to a whole body. Evidence gate deliberately still counts only
  the upper body (0-12) — legs are the noisiest keypoints, so they get a
  vote on GEOMETRY but never on whether a slot is a person at all.
  Frame f004: Linus fully sharp, daughter covered head to frame-bottom,
  single patch. gaze 88/88.
- **R2** (2026-08-25) — first run of the `woman` direction, and it
  immediately caught a HARNESS bug rather than a product bug: the run
  reported `g:"man"` while claiming to test `woman`. Calling
  `set_user_gender` directly looks like it works and does nothing —
  `open_platform` passes the launcher's stored gender through with the
  tile click and overwrites the Rust state a moment later. The harness
  now drives the launcher's own toggle and HARD-FAILS if the booted
  direction disagrees with the request, because a run that booted the
  wrong way is worse than no run: its frames look like evidence.
  Re-run (runs/r2b-woman): 0 EXPOSURE, 0 FALSE COVER on adults — Linus
  covered as expected. His daughter stays covered too, which is the age
  gate working as designed (under 18 ⇒ gender untrusted ⇒ never clears,
  in either direction) rather than a false cover.
  OPEN, and the next round's target: f000/f006/f008 carry 2-3 patches
  while the last pass reported 0 persons. That is the GHOST class and it
  matches the owner's "boxes spawn randomly and float around". Note the
  persons count is the value from the most recent pass, so some of these
  may be position-pass lag rather than true ghosts — settle that first
  by timestamping the persons count alongside the patch rects.
- **R3** (2026-08-25) — the "boxes spawn randomly and float around"
  complaint, diagnosed and fixed. NOT ghosts: the truth frames show real
  people under every patch. The defect was DUPLICATE patches — two
  tracks per person, drawn stacked with a visible seam.
  Two causes, both fixed:
  * merge used IoU only, which punishes a size difference. A full-body
    patch and a head-and-shoulders patch on one person score IoU ~0.14
    and never merged. Added MERGE_CONTAIN_MIN 0.6 on intersection-over-
    smaller-area, which asks the question that matters (is this patch
    essentially inside that one) and stays near zero for people standing
    side by side.
  * the duplicate tracks themselves: MoveNet reports a person, the
    full-frame face pass finds their face, `faceInsideAny` misses
    because the face box pokes outside the person box, and
    personFromFace mints a second person on top. New
    dedupeObservations() collapses them BEFORE association — merging at
    render time hid the seam but left two tracks competing for one
    person's gender reads, so a verdict landing on one left the other
    blurred forever.
  Before: 3 stacked patches over 2 people. After: exactly one patch per
  person, no seams (runs/r3-woman, runs/r3b-woman).
  COST, first measurement on the dev app: verdict pass p50 152ms,
  p95 554ms, max 3856ms; position pass p50 27ms, p95 37ms, max 57ms.
  The position pass is cheap and fine. The verdict tail is the problem —
  a 3.8s outlier on a desktop means a phone stalls, and the adaptive
  throttle reacts to it rather than preventing it. NEXT ROUND'S TARGET.
  Harness: frames are now captured in PAIRS, blur-on and blur-off at the
  same instant (owner idea), so scoring stops being guesswork about who
  is underneath a patch. gaze 93/93, cargo 31/31.
- **R5** (2026-08-25) — rotation entry 3, TED talk arj7oStGLkU, `man`,
  12 frames, bundle v7. **The failure INVERTS with subject scale.** That
  is the finding of this round and the target of the next.
  BEFORE (every frame read against its blur-off twin):
  EXPOSURE 4 (f003, f004, f005, f006) · FALSE COVER 3 (f000, f004, f005)
  · GHOST 0 · PARTIAL 0 · DRIFT 0.
  * CLOSE-UP frames (f001, f002, f007-f011) are PERFECT: persons=1, zero
    patches, the male speaker correctly sharp, track 10 'cleared' with
    clearStreak 15 and lastVerdict 'clear-certain'. The pipeline is right
    when the subject is big.
  * WIDE frames (f003-f006 — speaker ~12% of frame height, ~40-person
    audience) invert it: `persons` reads 0, yet f004/f005 still carry ONE
    patch and it sits over the MALE SPEAKER, while ~40 audience members —
    several clearly female in the lit right-hand block around x 0.78-0.90,
    y 0.74-0.90 — are completely sharp. Both terminal classes at once, and
    in the worst possible arrangement: the only person we track is the one
    who should be sharp, and everyone who should be covered is invisible
    to us. Same video, same code, seconds apart — scale is the only
    variable.
  * f000 is a separate, milder FALSE COVER: a new track starts BLURRED and
    needs 2 certain clear reads, so the speaker is covered for the first
    ~1.8s of the shot before clearing. Blur-first working as designed —
    but the owner's bar counts it, so it is logged, not excused.
  COST: verdict n=56 p50 97ms p95 340ms max 2416ms; position n=109 p50
  23ms p95 37ms max 51ms. The verdict tail improved markedly against R3
  (p95 554 -> 340, max 3856 -> 2416); the multi-second outlier survives.
  Harness: gauntlet.py now refuses a run whose start offset is past the
  end of the video. A seek past duration silently CLAMPS to the final
  frame, and R5's first attempt scored 12 identical frozen frames at
  t=76.08 while believing it was looking at a static shot.
  AFTER (runs/r5h-man, same video, same offsets):
  EXPOSURE 4 (unchanged) · FALSE COVER **3 -> 0** · GHOST 1 · PARTIAL 0 ·
  DRIFT 0. COST verdict p50 86 p95 330 max 1494 (from p95 340 max 2416);
  position p50 23 p95 36. gaze 100/100.
  WHAT CHANGED, and the measurement behind each:
  * **Two-tier person floor.** A new probe (person-gate lastSlotDiag)
    logged all six raw MoveNet slots BEFORE any gate. On every
    zero-person wide pass, slot 0 came back at 0.14-0.35 with 10-11 of 13
    confident keypoints — the speaker in full view, thrown away by our
    own PERSON_MIN_SCORE 0.35. Noise slots scored ~0 with 0-4 keypoints,
    so keypoint count separates person from noise where score cannot. A
    slot now gets in by scoring well OUTRIGHT or by carrying a strong
    skeleton (>=7 keypoints, score >=0.12). Every wide frame now reports
    persons=1 where it reported 0.
    This is the answer to the round's open question: the wide-shot miss
    was OUR THRESHOLD, not the model. It was free to fix. The audience is
    a genuinely different problem — their slots carry 0-4 keypoints, i.e.
    below the model's real floor, and most are back-of-head so no face
    path reaches them either. That needs multi-scale and it is NOT done.
  * **Track survival + wipe corroboration.** Coast is now cadence-aware
    (max(900ms, 2.5x the verdict interval)) because 900ms of wall time is
    less than one verdict pass on a Helio G88, which would flicker every
    covered person once per pass — a phone-only bug no desktop round can
    reproduce. wipeIfEmpty now needs TWO consecutive empty passes, but
    only when the last thing seen was SMALL: at small scale both
    detectors fail for the same reason, so their agreement is one blind
    spot counted twice, whereas a BIG subject vanishing really is a cut.
  * **Size-compatible association.** An oversized stale track overlaps
    everything, so on IoU alone it claimed every new detection, reset its
    own miss counter and became immortal. Boxes differing by more than 3x
    in area no longer associate.
  * **Identity break snaps the box.** When a descriptor stops matching we
    already reset the verdict; the box kept EMA-gliding from the old
    shot's geometry. If it is not the same person, the geometry is not
    theirs either.
  THREE REGRESSIONS CAUGHT AND FIXED INSIDE THE ROUND, each by re-running
  and looking rather than by reasoning:
  * unconditional wipe corroboration kept a stale close-up alive through
    a cut = near-full-frame blur (r5b f003) -> fixed by the size
    condition;
  * a plain area cap on low-tier slots rejected legitimate close-ups and
    drove FALSE COVER to 5 frames (r5e) -> replaced with a COHERENCE
    check (keypoint union vs the model's own box), because the tell is
    keypoints disagreeing with the box, not the box being large.
  STILL OPEN, and the next round's target:
  * **the cut frame.** f003 — the first wide frame after the close-up —
    still carries one near-full-frame patch, and it survived all four
    fixes above. It is a single transient frame at a shot change; the
    scene gate's luma-delta cut detector does not fire on this
    crossfade. Next round: instrument the cut path directly rather than
    guessing which layer mints that box.
  * **audience EXPOSURE (4 frames, unchanged).** Needs multi-scale
    recall, and per the critic that must NOT ship before the verdict
    budget can absorb what it finds: ZOOM_MAX_PERSONS is 3, so finding
    40 people would give each a gender read every ~5s while all of them
    start blurred — converting EXPOSURE into mass FALSE COVER, which is
    a lateral move, not a fix.
  Harness: gauntlet.py now waits out the ad/load window before trusting
  `duration` (during a pre-roll the element reports the AD's duration, so
  an 843s talk briefly looks like a 6s clip and the guard rejected a good
  run).
