    //     with bank size BY CONSTRUCTION, independently of who is on
    //     screen. Measured across one 15s window: the best-match FLOOR
    //     climbed from 0.00 (bank of 2) to 0.68 (bank of 6+), against a
    //     threshold of 0.85.
    //   * The bank saturated at MEM_MAX 8 within ~15 seconds of two
    //     people being on screen, and in R13's run it was already at the
    //     cap on the FIRST captured frame.
    //   * The descriptor cannot separate identity at this operating
    //     point at all: docs/detection-engine.md registers 17% of
    //     DIFFERENT-person pairs scoring >=0.9, against a same-person
    //     5th percentile of 0.28. Those distributions overlap across
    //     their whole useful range, so there is no threshold to move to
    //     — with 8 entries x 3 exemplars the false-match probability is
    //     ~1-(1-0.17)^24, i.e. essentially certain.
    //
    // Put together: given a few seconds of video, memory returns
    // "blurred" for almost any face, and the entry doing the covering
    // usually belongs to someone else. R11 measured the end state — a
    // woman reading a CERTAIN CLEAR stayed covered for all ten frames
    // while the bank sat pinned at the cap. That is the mechanism behind
    // the owner's oldest complaint, "why does it keep blurring me": in
    // man mode the bank fills with women and then re-covers HIM.
    //
    // What removing it costs, honestly, because it is not zero: a person
    // who was once read as certainly opposite-gender and who now reads
    // UNCERTAIN no longer gets re-covered on someone else's cleared
    // track. That case is a person swap, which is an identity question,
    // and the measurement above says this descriptor cannot answer it.
    // It is instead bounded by the two mechanisms that do not depend on

    // A DUTY-CYCLE GOVERNOR, NOT A GUESS. (owner 2026-08-27: "the
    // YouTube app still feels sluggish and not like how it generally
    // feels")
    //
    // FIRST REAL NUMBER THIS PROJECT HAS FOR A SLOW DEVICE. The dev app
    // was CPU-throttled 6x through CDP -- the conventional low-end-mobile
    // factor, and it throttles the MAIN THREAD, which is exactly the
    // resource our pipeline and YouTube's lazy comment/related callbacks
    // compete for. 30s of playback, same page, same video position, the
    // in-player pill as the A/B:
    //
    //   blur ON : 137 long tasks, 19,769ms of them, worst single 2,329ms
    //   blur OFF: 0 long tasks
    //
    // Two thirds of wall-clock with the main thread blocked. That is the
    // whole complaint, and it is ours, not YouTube's.
    //
    // The old multiplier was 1.5, i.e. "spend up to 67% of the main
    // thread on inference for ever". That is a fine rule for a machine
    // that finishes a pass in 25ms and a catastrophic one for a machine
    // that takes 150ms, because the SAME fraction of a much scarcer
    // thread is what the user feels. A duty cycle states the budget
    // directly: a pass may occupy at most 1/DUTY of the time until the
    // next one.
    //
    // ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE, because the two passes carry different
    // risk. The POSITION pass is what discovers a new person, and
    // blur-first means discovery is the only step that can leave someone
    // uncovered -- so it keeps the tighter budget (50%). The VERDICT
    // pass only decides whether someone already covered may be CLEARED;
    // stretching it makes people stay blurred slightly longer, which is
    // the safe direction by definition. Its ceiling is raised to 2s for
    // the same reason: on a device where a verdict costs 600ms, the old
    // 1s cap meant verdicts ran back-to-back with no gap at all.
    // THE HARD BUDGET, and it is the one that actually binds.
    //
    // The two duty multipliers below are per-pass-TYPE, and the first
    // throttled re-measurement showed why that is not enough: a verdict
    // pass records into lastVerdictMs, which gates only the zoom
    // interval, so its cost never widened the outer gate at all (review
    // A11 split them deliberately, to stop one expensive verdict
    // throttling the cheap position passes to 1Hz). The result was that
    // halving the position duty moved total blocked time 19,769 ->
    // 19,160ms out of 30,000: nothing, because position passes were
    // never what was spending it.
    //
    // So the budget is enforced on the RESOURCE rather than on either
    // pass: how many milliseconds of main thread has the pipeline used
    // in the last second, whoever used them. Above the share, the next
    // pass waits. This bounds the number the owner is feeling -- 66% of
    // wall-clock blocked -- directly, on any device, without either
    // pass type having to know about the other.
    //
    // 0.35 leaves roughly two thirds of the thread to YouTube, which is
    // what has to be true for its lazy comment and related-rail
    // callbacks to run while he scrolls. On this desktop a pass costs
    // ~25ms against a 120ms floor (~20%), so the budget never binds and

    // seated subject who reads `uncertain` with a ~50px face still reads

    // Two further reasons not to re-try this: raising the rung spends the
    // owner's mobile data on a Helio G88 for zero visible gain, and
    // YouTube's setPlaybackQuality has been a documented no-op since
    // 2019, so the only remaining lever writes the platform's own
    // storage — outside BLOCK-ONLY as written.
    //
    // What DID come out of it is a harness rule, not product code: two
    // runs of the same video minutes apart differed 854x480 vs 1280x720,
    // so `vw`/`vh` is now recorded per frame and a resolution mismatch
    // invalidates a cross-round comparison.
    // THE PILL HAS TO OUTRANK YOUTUBE'S OWN CONTROL CHROME, and inside
    // #movie_player it cannot. MEASURED 2026-08-31 on a live m.youtube
    // watch page: #movie_player carries a transform, so it creates a
    // stacking context and our z-index of 2147483645 is capped at that
    // element's own level. YouTube's controls are NOT in there --
    // `.player-controls-background` (position absolute, opacity 0,
    // pointer-events auto, covering the whole 412x231 player) lives
    // under #player-control-container, a LATER SIBLING of #player, both
    // children of #player-container-id. So it paints over everything
    // inside the player, the pill included.
    //
    // That element does not exist on a freshly loaded page -- YouTube
    // builds its control overlay on the FIRST TAP on the video, and it
    // then stays for the life of the page. MEASURED, one trace: fresh
    // page, a tap on the pill toggles "Blur on" -> "Blur off"; one tap
    // on the video; six seconds later the controls have autohidden but
    // the background remains and elementFromPoint at the pill's centre
    // returns `player-controls-background`; a tap on the pill now does
    // NOTHING ("Blur off" -> "Blur off") and a press with 25px of thumb
    // roll shrinks the player to 347x195 instead. His blur switch died
    // the moment he touched the video, and became a drag handle.
    //
    // #player-container-id is the fix: a sibling of the control
    // container, later in the DOM, and still inside the player subtree
    // so element fullscreen keeps the pill rendered -- YouTube's own
    // controls live outside #movie_player too and are visible in
    // fullscreen, so the fullscreen element is at or above this one.
