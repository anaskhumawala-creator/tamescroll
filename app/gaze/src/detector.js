// v1 was presence-only ("is there a face"). The protection engine's
// gender stage (docs/handoff-protection-engine.md decision #3) needs
// per-face boxes + per-face gender, so the decode now runs in full:
// classificator logits + box regressors -> anchors -> NMS -> boxes,
// then gender (Oarriaga mini-Xception, 64x64 grayscale) per surviving
// box. NMS + decode run in plain JS off a SINGLE tensor download: every
// extra GPU->CPU download is a fence wait, and hidden pages clamp those
// to ~1s each (Chrome nested-timer throttling, found 2026-08-23).
