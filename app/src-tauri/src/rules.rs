//! Builds the adblock-rust engine from the vendored filter lists and
//! scriptlet resources. Split out of lib.rs because the list of vendored
//! files is long and only grows; lib.rs stays focused on the app shell.
//!
//! Everything here is compiled into the binary (`include_str!`), the same
//! convention `rules/youtube.txt` already used, so a shipped build never
//! reads these files off disk. Refresh the snapshots with
//! `node scripts/update-lists.mjs`; see rules/vendor/README.md.
//!
//! Scriptlets are OUR OWN clean-room implementations (MPL-2.0) in
//! `app/src-tauri/scriptlets/` — uBlock Origin's scriptlet file is GPLv3
//! and compiling GPL code into this MPL binary would both violate the
//! repo's licence rule (see NOTICE) and poison App Store distribution.
//! The filter LISTS below reference scriptlets by name; our resources
//! answer to those names.
//!
//! Our own three cosmetic files (youtube/reddit/x) are NOT fed into the
//! `FilterSet` below (Phase 3, docs/plan.md settings pane) — per-surface
//! "bring back" toggles need to turn individual selectors on and off,
//! which the engine's opaque cosmetic-filter cache does not support.
//! Instead `parse_surfaces` below reads the same files' `!surface: <id>
//! <Label>` markers and groups their rules by surface; lib.rs assembles
//! the CSS itself. Vendor lists and blur CSS are untouched by this split.
